# Proton Technologies Mobile Dev Test

## Time Limit - 3 Days


## Overview
T his exercise is meant to test your coding skills as well as how you approach the app development process general. Your task is to take the provided sample app and improve it based on the basic description in this document, as well as your own expectation of code quality. How you choose to approach this task is up to you and you should make your own judgements about what’s most important to fix first and take a best guess if unsure about something.

You should approach this app with the attitude that you and other developers may have to expand and maintain it for an unknown number of years and will likely outlive you working on it.

Since the time is limited, you are not expected to fix everything, so if you identify something as taking a long time to fix, just leave it.

## Task
The purpose of this app is to retrieve basic weather information from a RESTful API (already in the source code) and present that information in master and detail screens. Basic data should be downloaded automatically at app launch and images downloaded on request by the user. The app should be able to fall back on a cache in case the API is unavailable.

### Master Screen
The master screen should have “Forecast” in the navigation bar. Below the navigation bar should be a pair of tabs with the options “Upcoming” and “Hottest”. Below these buttons should be a table view displaying the relevant forecasts and in the correct order.
- Upcoming: All upcoming days returned by the API in order of day
- Hottest: Any days that have less than a 50% chance of rain, ordered hottest to coldest

The rows should be in the format “Day \<day>: \<description>” where day and description are keys returned by the API. If the image for a particular day is downloaded (initiated by the user in the detail screen), then the row should be updated with a thumbnail.

### Detail Screen
The navigation bar title should be in the form “Day \<day>”. Below the navigation bar the weather data should be laid out in a consistent manor as you see fit using appropriate units and values. Below the text data you should display the image (once downloaded). Display a “Download Image” button aligned to the bottom of the screen, which should disappear upon successful download.
